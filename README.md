# fabrik-ik-motor6d

FABRIK based inverse kinematics solver made to work with roblox's motor6d rigging system.

If you want to experiment then I recommend you download the releases.

To Do List:

--priority one In order to look visually good
Use CFrame.FromAxis to manipulate motor6d joints between original vector and new vector

Brainstorm ways to better constraint a vector in a region:
1. Utilize rotated region3 to create space where vector can reside

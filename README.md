# fabrik-ik-motor6d

FABRIK based inverse kinematics solver made to work with roblox's motor6d rigging system.

If you want to experiment and use the project then I recommend you download the releases and download the entire source-code in a zip file and open up the place file.

Partial Documentation can be found in my Roblox thread post on community resources:

Current To Do List:

Work to procedural generation, and solving bugs along the way.
